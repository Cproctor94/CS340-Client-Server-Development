# CS340-Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Maintaining a program would entail adding functionality and keeping it up to date, which just requires that you make everything modular and reusable. This makes it possible to expand on a program without constantly needing to rebuild it. To make your code readable, follow a logical flow, and include detailed comments that explain what the reader is looking at. Maintainability and adaptability go hand in hand. If your code is modular and each function only does one primary task, then you may modify that function to almost any other incoming or exiting data type to meet your current needs.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I would approach an issue by first identifying the tools I would require to get the desired result. Then, I would construct the most fundamental tools first, followed by the code that executes those lower-level operations. In comparison to earlier assignments, this one was particularly unique. This was the first time I had ever used a database. The method of creating a database, the CRUD module, and then utilizing that to create the interactive page was interesting. In the past, I would just utilize objects themselves as my storage mechanisms, along with arrays, vectors, and so forth. That is difficult, especially when there is a lot of data involved. More was accomplished with this project than that. I'll absolutely apply the methods I've learned here, particularly the CRUD module. Already, I'm considering how to apply that to a SQL database I'm creating for a personal website project. If I ever work on something with a lot of data and limited search time, aggregate will be a useful tool.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better

Computer scientists find solutions. They create software that can perform exact computations that are time-consuming and prone to error at speeds that people simply cannot attain manually. They provide products that facilitate better work and life for both individuals and organizations. This is significant because computers have altered how society operates. Without computers and computer scientists, complex animated entertainment (such as 3D graphics films) would not be possible, video games would no longer be made, and routine tasks like tallying up the number of employees for numerous enterprises spread across states would take hours rather than seconds. Work on a similar project could assist businesses in quickly and affordably locating the resources they require. For each duty in this project, the organization had a particular breed of dog and age range in mind. The 10,000 dog records would require hours of manual research. That task is now quick, efficient, and extendable thanks to this initiative. Even with an additional 10,000 dogs, it would still function. As a result, the task is done just once rather than each time new data is uploaded.
